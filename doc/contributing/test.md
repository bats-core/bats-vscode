## How to test the syntax and snippets?

Automation has not been provided on the current module yet.

We recommend installing custom colorization as explained in the module [README.md](../../README.md) or below. Add this to your VS Code settings:

```json
{
    "editor.tokenColorCustomizations": {
        "textMateRules": [
            {
                "scope": "keyword.control.bats",
                "settings": {
                    "foreground": "#9f1fd1",
                    "fontStyle": "italic"
                }
            },
            {
                "scope": "support.function.bats",
                "settings": {
                    "foreground": "#d41515",
                    "fontStyle": "italic"
                }
            },
            {
                "scope": "support.variable.bats",
                "settings": {
                    "foreground": "#329432",
                    "fontStyle": "italic"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

You can now go to the `test` folder and check if the module behave as expected.

> Do not forget to manage proper non-regression testing and not only testing your personal updates.

## ESLint

According to the few JS code on that specific module, the ESLint config and tasks have not been configured yet.

## Markdown lint

There is a `.markdownlint.json` file to preconfigure Lint your docs.
The MDlint task has not been set yet.

If you use the VSCode plugin it will be managed while you're typing.
Otherwise, you can use the terminal to do it manually.
